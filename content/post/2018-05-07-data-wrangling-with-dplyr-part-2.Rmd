## Introduction

In the previous post we learnt about dplyr verbs and used them to compute 
average order value for an online retail company data. In this post, we will 
learn to combine tables using different `*_join` functions provided in dplyr. 

## Libraries, Code & Data

We will use the following packages: 

- [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) 
- [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html)  

The data sets can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets) 
and the codes from [here](https://gist.github.com/aravindhebbali/3e31f13a4194a8f1003034aa7d70d5ee).

```{r dplyr1, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

## Case Study

For our case study, we will use two data sets. The first one, `order`, contains
details of orders placed by different customers. The second data set, `customer`
contains details of each customer. The below table displays the details stored
in each data set.

<br>

```{r img1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/join_data.png")
```

<br>

Let us import both the data sets using `read_csv`.

### Data: Orders

```{r dplyr2, message=FALSE}
order <- read_delim('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/order.csv', delim = ';')
order
```

### Data: Customers

```{r dplyr, message=FALSE}
customer <- read_delim('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/customer.csv', delim = ';')
customer
```

We will explore the following in the case study:

- details of customers who have placed orders and their order details
- details of customers and their orders irrespective of whether a customer has 
placed orders or not
- customer details for each order
- details of customers who have placed orders
- details of customers who have not placed orders
- details of all customers and all orders

## Example Data

We will use another data set to illustrate how the different joins work. You can
view the example data sets below.

<br>

```{r img2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/join.png")
```

<br>

## Inner Join

<br>

```{r img3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/draw_inner.png")
```

<br>

Inner join return all rows from `Age` where there are matching values in 
`Height`, and all columns from `Age` and `Height`. If there are multiple matches 
between `Age` and `Height`, all combination of the matches are returned.

#### Case Study: Details of customers who have placed orders and their order details

To get data for all those customers who have placed orders in the past let us 
join the `order` data with the `customer` data using `inner_join`. 

```{r dplyr3}
inner_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Left Join

<br>

```{r img4, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/draw_left.png")
```

<br>

Left join return all rows from `Age`, and all columns from `Age` and `Height`. 
Rows in `Age` with  no match in `Height` will have NA values in the new columns. 
If there are multiple  matches between `Age` and `Height`, all combinations of 
the matches are returned.

#### Case Study: Details of customers and their orders irrespective of whether a customer has 
placed orders or not.

To get data for all those customers and their orders irrespective of whether a 
customer has placed orders or not let us join the `order` data with the 
`customer` data using `left_join`. 


```{r dplyr4}
left_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Right Join

<br>

```{r img5, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/draw_right.png")
```

<br>

Right join return all rows from `Height`, and all columns from `Age` and 
`Height`. Rows in `Height` with no match in `Age` will have NA values in the 
new columns. If there are multiple matches between `Age` and `Height`, all 
combinations of the matches are returned.

#### Case Study: Customer details for each order

To get customer data for all orders, let us join the `order` data with the 
`customer` data using `right_join`. 

```{r dplyr5}
right_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Semi Join

<br>

```{r img6, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/draw_semi.png")
```

<br>

Semi join return all rows from `Age` where there are matching values in `Height`, 
keeping just columns from `Age`. A semi join differs from an inner join because 
an inner join will return one row of `Age` for each matching row of `Height`, 
where a semi join will never duplicate rows of `Age`.

#### Case Study: Details of customers who have placed orders

To get customer data for all orders where customer data exists, let us join the `order` data with the 
`customer` data using `semi_join`. You can observe that data is returned only for those
cases where customer data is present.

```{r dplyr6}
semi_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Anti Join

<br>

```{r img7, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/draw_anti.png")
```

<br>

Anti join return all rows from `Age` where there are not matching values in 
`Height`, keeping just columns from `Age`.

#### Case Study: Details of customers who have not placed orders

To get details of customers who have not placed orders, let us join the `order` 
data with the `customer` data using `anti_join`. 

```{r dplyr7}
anti_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Full Join

<br>

```{r img8, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/draw_full.png")
```

<br>

Full join return all rows and all columns from both `Age` and `Height`. Where 
there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing.

#### Case Study: Details of all customers and all orders

To get details of all customers and all orders, let us join the `order` 
data with the `customer` data using `full_join`. 

```{r dplyr8}
full_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```
