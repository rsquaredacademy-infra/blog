Ever wondered why items are displayed in a particular way in retail/online 
stores. Why certain items are suggested to you based on what you have added to 
the cart? Blame it on market basket analysis or association rule mining. 

## Resources

Below are the links to all the resources related to this post:

## What?

```{r mba_what, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_what.png")
```

Market basket analysis uses association rule mining under the hood to identify
products frequently bought together. Before we get into the nitty gritty of 
market basket analysis, let us get a basic understanding of association rule 
mining. It finds association between different objects in a set. In the case 
of market basket analysis, the objects are the products purchased by a cusomter 
and the set is the transaction. In short, market basket analysis 

- is a unsupervised data mining technique 
- that uncovers products frequently bought together
- and creates if-then scenario rules

## Why ?

```{r why, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_why.png")
```

Market basket analysis creates actionable insights for:

- designing store layout
- online recommendation engines
- targeted marketing campaign/sales promotion/email campaign
- cross/up selling 
- catalogue design

## Advantages

```{r advantages, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_advantages.png")
```

Market basket analysisis is **cost effective** as data required is readily 
available through electronic point of sale systems. It generates 
**actionable insights** for product placement, cross/up selling strategies, 
targeted marketing campaigns, catalogue design, pricing strategies, 
inventory control etc.

## Use Cases

```{r use_cases, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_use_cases.png")
```

Association rule mining has applications in several industries including
retail, telecommunications, banking, insurance, manufacturing and medical.
Let us look at its applications in more detail in the following industries:

### Retail

The introduction of electronic point of sale systems have allowed the 
collection of immense amounts of data and retail organizations make prolifc 
use of market basket analysis for 

- designing store layout so that consumers can more easily find items that are 
frequently purchased together
- recommending associated products that are frequently bought together,
**“Customers who purchased this product also viewed this product…”**
- emailing customers who bought products specific products with other products 
and offers on those products that are likely to be interesting to them.
- grouping products that customers purchase frequently together in the store’s 
product placement
- designing special promotions that combine or discount certain products
- optimizing the layout of the catalog of an eCommerce site
- controlling inventory based on product demands and what products sell better 
together

### Banks

Banks and financial institutions use market basket analysis to analyze credit 
card purchases for fraud detection and cross sell insurance products, 
investment products (mutual funds etc.), tax preparation, retirement planning,
wealth management etc. It can also be used for next best offer, sequence and
seasonal offers.

### Telecommunications

The telecommunications industry is characterized by high volatility and low
customer loyalty due to lucrative offers for new customers from other service
providers. The more services a customer uses from a particular operator, the 
harder it gets for him/her to switch to another operator. Market basket 
analysis is used to bundle mobile, landline, TV and internet services to 
customers to increase stickiness and reduce churn.

## Simple Example

```{r simple_example, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_items_description.png")
```

Before we move on to the case study, let us use a simple example to understand
the important terminologies that we will come across in the rest of the 
tutorial. In the example, the transactions include the following products:

- mobile phones
- ear phones
- USB cable
- power bank
- screen guard
- mobile case cover
- modem/router
- mouse
- external hard drive

## Steps

```{r steps, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_steps.png")
```

The two important steps in market basket analysis are:

- frequent itemset generation
- rules generation

We will discuss these steps in more detail in the case study.

## Itemset

```{r itemset, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_itemset.png")
```

Itemset is the collection of items purchased by a customer. In our example,
mobile phone and screen guard are a frequent intemset. They are present in 
3 out of 5 transactions.

## Antecedent & Consequent

```{r ante_cons, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_antecedent_consequent.png")
```

Antecedent is the items of the left hand side of the rule and consequent is 
the right hand side of the rule. In our example, mobile phone is the antecedent
and screen guard is the consequent. 

## Support

```{r support, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_support.png")
```

Support is the probability of the antecedent event occuring. It is the relative
frequency of the itemset. If it is less than 50% then the association is 
considered less fruitful. In our example, support is the relative frequency of
transactions that include both mobile phone and screen guard.

## Confidence 

```{r confidence, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_confidence.png")
```

Confidence is the probability the consequent will co-occur with the antecedent.
It expresses the operational efficiency of the rule. In our example, it is the 
probability that a customer will purchase screen guard provided that he has 
already bought the mobile phone.

## Lift

```{r lift, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_lift.png")
```

The lift ratio calculates the efficiency of the rule in finding consequences, 
compared to a random selection of transactions. Generally, a Lift ratio of 
greater than one suggests some applicability of the rule.To compute the lift 
for a rule, divide the support of the itemset by the product of the support 
for antecedent and consequent. Now, let us understand how to interpret lift.

### Interpretation

- **Lift = 1**: implies no relationship between mobile phone and screen guard 
(i.e., mobile phone and screen guard occur together only by chance)
- **Lift > 1**: implies that there is a positive relationship between mobile 
phone and screen guard (i.e., mobile phone and screen guard occur together 
more often than random)
- **Lift < 1**: implies that there is a negative relationship between mobile 
phone and screen guard (i.e., mobile phone and screen guard occur together 
less often than random)

## Data

Two public data sets are available for users to explore and learn market basket 
analysis:

- <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail#" target="_blank">UCI</a>
- <a href="https://data.world/datasets/market-basket-analysis" target="_blank">data.world</a>

The groceries data set is available in the **arules** package as well. In this 
tutorial, we will use the UCI data set as it closely resembles real world data 
sets giving us a chance to reshape the data and restructure it in format 
required by the **arules** package.

## Data Dictionary

- invoice number
- stock code
- description
- quantity
- invoice date
- unit price
- customer id
- country

## Libraries 

```{r libs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Preprocessing

This section is optional. You can skip to the **Read Data** section without
any loss of continuity.

```{r pre_process, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_pre_process.png")
```

As shown above, the data set has one row per item. We have created a tiny R 
package <a href="https://github.com/rsquaredacademy/mbar" target="_blank">mbar</a>,  
for data pre-processing. It can be installed from GitHub as shown below:

```{r mbar, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rsquaredacademy/mbar")
```

We will use `mbar_prep_data()` from the mbar package to reshape the data so 
that there is one row per transaction with items across columns excluding 
the column names. 

```{r preprocess}
library(mbar)
mba_data     <- read_excel("online-retail.xlsx")
transactions <- mbar_prep_data(mba_data, InvoiceNo, Description)
head(transactions)
```

## EDA

Before we generate the rules using the **arules** package, let us explore
the data set a bit.

### What time of day do people purchase?

```{r eda_1, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
purchase_time <-
  mba_data %>%
  group_by(InvoiceDate) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = hour(InvoiceDate)) %>%
  pull(time_of_day) %>%
  as.factor() %>%
  fct_count()

purchase_time %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = f, y = n), fill = "blue") +
  xlab("Hour of Day") + ylab("Transactions") +
  ggtitle("Hourly Transaction Distribution")  
```

### How many items are purchased on an average?

```{r eda_2}
items <- 
  mba_data %>%
  group_by(InvoiceNo) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  pull(count) 

mean(items)
median(items)
```

### Most Purchased Items

```{r eda_4}
mba_data %>%
  group_by(Description) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

### Average Order Value

```{r eda_5}
total_revenue <- 
  mba_data %>%
  group_by(InvoiceNo) %>%
  summarize(order_sum = sum(UnitPrice)) %>%
  pull(order_sum) %>%
  sum()

total_transactions <- 
  mba_data %>%
  group_by(InvoiceNo) %>%
  summarize(n()) %>%
  nrow()

total_revenue / total_transactions
```

## Read Data

It is now time to read data into R. We will use `read.transactions()`
from **arules** package. The data cannot be read using `read.csv()` or
`read_csv()` owing to the way it is structured. We will read the 
`transaction_data.csv` file as it contains the data we had modified
in the previous step. We need to specify the following in order to 
read the data set:

- name of the data set within quotes (single or double)
- the format of the data, if each line represnts a transaction, use `basket`,
and if each line represents an item in the transaction, use `single`
- the separator used to separate the items in a transaction

In our data set, each line represents a transaction and the items in the
transaction are separated by a `,`.

```{r read_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
basket_data <- read.transactions("transaction_data.csv", format = "basket", 
  sep = ",")
basket_data
```

The `read.transactions()` function allows you to read data where each row 
represents a item and not a transaction. In that case, the `format` argument
should be set to the value `single` and the `cols` argument should specify
the names or positions of the columns that represent the **transaction id** and
**item id**. We tried to read data in this way as well but failed to do so. 
However, the code is available below for other users to try and let us know if
you find a way to get it to work or spot any mistakes we may have made.

```{r read_data_try, eval=FALSE}
get_data <- read.transactions("retail.csv", 
  format = "single",
  sep = ",",
  cols = c("InvoiceNo", "item"))
``` 

We were able to read the data when we removed the `sep` argument from the above
code, but the result from the `summary()` function was way different than what
we see in the next section i.e. it showed higher number of transactions and
items.

## Data Summary

To get a quick overview of the data, use `summary()`. It will return the 
following:

- number of transactions
- number of items
- most frequent items
- distribution of items
- five number summary 

```{r summary}
summary(basket_data)
```

## Item Frequency Plot

The most frequent items in the data set can be plotted using 
`itemFrequencyPlot()`. We can specify the number of items to be plotted and
whether the `Y` axis should represent the absolute or relative number of transactions
that include the item.

The `topN` argument can be used to specify the number of items to be plotted
and the `type` argument can be used to specify whether the `Y` axis represents
absolute/relative frequency of the items.

```{r plot_freq, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
itemFrequencyPlot(basket_data, topN = 10, type = 'absolute')
```

In the below plot, the `Y` axis represents the relative frequency of the items
plotted.

```{r plot_freq_relative, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
itemFrequencyPlot(basket_data, topN = 10, type = 'relative')
```

## Generate Rules

Finally, to the part you all have been waiting for, rules generation. The 
`apriori()` function is used for generating the rules. We will first learn the 
different inputs that must be specified and later on play around with them and
see how the rules generated change.

The first input is the data set, which in our case is `basket_data`. Next, we 
will supply the mining parameters using the `parameter` argument:

- `supp`: minimum **support** for an itemset 
- `conf`: minimum **confidence**
- `maxlen`: maximum number of items the antecedent may include 
- `target`: the type of association mined i.e. **rules**

The `parameter` argument takes several additional inputs but to get started, it
is sufficient to know those mentioned above. All the inputs are supplied using
a `list()`.

For our case study, we will specify the following:

- support: 0.009
- confidence: 0.8
- maxlen: 4 

Keep in mind, mining association rules with very low values for `support` will 
result in a large number of rules being generated, resulting in long execution 
time and the process will eventually run out of memory. 

```{r rules_generate}
rules <- apriori(basket_data, parameter = list(supp=0.009, conf=0.8, 
	target = "rules", maxlen = 4))
```

Change the values of `supp`, `conf` and `maxlen`, and observe how the rules
generated change. 

## Rules Summary

Once the rules have been generated by `apriori()`, we can use `summary()` to
get some basic information such as rule length distribution.

```{r rules_summary}
summary(rules)
```

The output from `summary()` does not display the rules though. To view the 
rules, we have to use `inspect()`.

## Inspect Rules

The `inspect()` function will display the rules along with:

- support
- confidence
- lift 
- count

Before you inspect the rules, you can sort it by support, confidence or
lift. In the below, output, we sort the rules by confidence in descending order
before inspecting them.

```{r rules_inspect}
basket_rules <- sort(rules, by = 'confidence', decreasing = TRUE)
inspect(basket_rules[1:10])
```

## Redundant & Non Redundant Rules

### Redundant Rules

A rule is redundant if a more general rules with the same or a higher 
confidence exists. That is, a more specific rule is redundant if it is only 
equally or even less predictive than a more general rule. A rule is more 
general if it has the same RHS but one or more items removed from the LHS.

#### Example 1

```{r red_rule_1, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_redundant_rule_1.png")
```

In the above example, the first rule has the same support, condifence and lift
as the next two rules. The second item in the left hand side of the rule is not
adding any value and as such makes the rule redundant.

#### Example 2

```{r red_rule_2, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_redundant_rule_2.png")
```

In the above example, the first two rules have the same support, condifence and 
lift. The third rule differs only with respect to lift. 

#### Example 3

```{r red_rule_3, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_redundant_rule_3.png")
```

In the above example, the first and third rule have the same support, 
condifence and lift. The second rule is different with respect to confidence 
and lift. 

Now that we have understood what redundant rules are and how to identify them, 
let us use the below R code to inspect them.

```{r rules_redundant}
inspect(rules[is.redundant(rules)])
```

### Non-redundant Rules

Now let us look at the non-redundant rules.

```{r rules_non_redundant}
inspect(rules[!is.redundant(rules)])
```

## What influenced purchase of product X?

So far, we have learnt how to generate, inspect and prune rules. Now, how do
we use these rules? To make business sense, we need to come up with a set of
rules that can be used either for product placement in physical stores or 
as recommendations in an online store or for targeted marketing via email
campaigns etc. To achieve that, we need to know 2 things:

- what products influenced the purchase of product X?
- what purchases did product X influence?

For our case study, we can modify the above questions as:

#### What influenced the purchase of **sugar**?

To view the products which influenced the purchase of **sugar**, we will 
continue to use the `apriori()` function but add one more argument, `appearance`.
It restricts the appearance of the items. Since we want the right hand side of 
the rules to have only one value, **sugar**, we will set the `rhs` argument to 
**sugar**. The left hand side of the rules should include all the products that 
influenced the purchase of sugar i.e. it will exclude **sugar**. We will use 
the `default` argument and supply it the value `lhs` i.e. all items excluding 
sugar can appear on the left hand side of the rule by default.

- `default`
- `rhs`

```{r rhs}
sugar_rules <- apriori(basket_data, parameter = list(supp = 0.009, conf = 0.8), 
  appearance = list(default = "lhs", rhs = "SUGAR")) 
rules_sugar <- sort(sugar_rules, by = "confidence", decreasing = TRUE)
inspect(rules_sugar)
```

For the support and confidence we have mentioned, we know the following 
products influenced the purchase of **sugar**:

- **COFFEE**
- **SET 3 RETROSPOT TEA**

## What purchases did product X influence?

Now that we know what products influenced the purchase of **sugar**, let us 
answer the second question.

#### What purchases did **sugar** influence?

In this case, we want **sugar** to be on the left hand side of the rule and all
the products it influenced to be on the right hand side. We set the `lhs` 
argument to **sugar** and the `default` argument to `rhs` as all the products, 
the purchase of which was influenced by **sugar** should appear on the left 
hand side of the rule by default.

```{r lhs}
sugar_rules <- apriori(basket_data, parameter = list(supp = 0.009, conf = 0.8), 
  appearance = list(default = "rhs", lhs = "SUGAR")) 
rules_sugar <- sort(sugar_rules, by = "confidence", decreasing = TRUE)
inspect(rules_sugar)
```

For the support and confidence we have mentioned, we know the purchase of 
the following products were influenced by **sugar**:

- **COFFEE**
- **SET 3 RETROSPOT TEA**

## Top Rules

Let us take a look at the top rules by 

#### Support

```{r top_rules_supp}
supp_rules <- sort(rules, by = 'support', decreasing = TRUE)
top_rules <- supp_rules[1:10]
inspect(top_rules)
```

#### Confidence

```{r top_rules_conf}
conf_rules <- sort(rules, by = 'confidence', decreasing = TRUE)
top_rules <- conf_rules[1:10]
inspect(top_rules)
```

#### Lift

```{r top_rules_lift}
lift_rules <- sort(rules, by = 'lift', decreasing = TRUE)
top_rules <- lift_rules[1:10]
inspect(top_rules)
```

<hr>

## Visualization

To visualize the rules, the authors of **arules** have created a companion
package, **arulesViz**. It offers several options for visualizing the rules
generated by `apriori()`. 

### Scatter Plot

We can use the default `plot()` method to create a scatter plot. It will plot 
the support on the `X` axis, the confidence on the `Y` axis and the lift is 
represented by the opaqueness/alpha of the color of the points.

```{r plot_scatter, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(basket_rules)
```

### Network Plot

We can create a network plot using the `method` argument and supplying it the 
value `graph`. You can see the directionality of the rule in the below plot. 
For example, people who buy **shed** also buy **key fob** and similarly, people
who buy **back door** also buy **key fob**. It will be difficult to identify 
the directionality of the rules when we are trying to plot too many rules.
The `method` argument takes several other values as well.

```{r plot_network, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
plot(top_rules, method = 'graph')
```

## Things to keep in mind..

#### Directionality of rule is lost while using lift

The directionality of a rule is lost while using lift. In the below example, 
the lift is same for both the following rules:

- {Mobile Phone} => {Screen Guard}
- {Screen Guard} => {Mobile Phone}

It is clear that the lift is the same irrespective of the direction of the rule.

```{r lift_warning, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_lift_warning_final.png")
```

#### Confidence as a measure can be misleading

If you look at the below example, the confidence for the second rule, 
**{Screen Guard} => {Mobile Phone}**, is greater than the first rule, 
**{Mobile Phone} => {Screen Guard}**. It does not mean that we can recommend 
a mobile phone to a customer who is purchasing a screen guard. It is important 
to ensure that we do not use rules just because they have high confidence 
associated with them.

```{r conf_warning, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_conf_warn_final.png")
```

## Summary

- market basket analysis is an unsupervised data mining technique
- uncovers products frequently bought together
- creates if-then scenario rules
- cost-effective, insightful and actionable
- association rule mining has applications in several industries
- directionality of rule is lost while using lift
- confidence as a measure can be misleading

```{r summary_meme, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/mba_summary_meme.jpg")
```

Your knowledge of the domain/business matters a lot when you are trying to 
use market basket analysis. Especially, when you are trying to select or 
shortlist rules and use them for product placement in a store or for 
recommending products online. It is a good practice to critically review the
rules before implementing them.
