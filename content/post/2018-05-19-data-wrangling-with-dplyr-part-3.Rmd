## Introduction

In the previous [post](https://blog.aravindhebbali.com/2017/12/25/data-wrangling-with-dplyr-part-2/), 
we learnt to combine tables using dplyr. In this post, we will explore a set of 
helper functions in order to:

- extract unique rows 
- rename columns
- sample data
- extract columns
- slice rows
- arrange rows
- compare tables
- extract/mutate data using predicate functions
- count observations for different levels of a variable

## Libraries, Code & Data

We will use the following packages:

- [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html) 
- [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html)  

The data sets can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets) 
and the codes from [here](https://gist.github.com/aravindhebbali/55c4f40476028c09949b73af97bb1619).

```{r dplyr1, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

## Case Study

Let us look at a case study (e-commerce data) and see how we can use dplyr 
helper functions to answer questions we have about and to modify/transform the 
underlying data set. 

### Data

```{r show, message=FALSE}
ecom <- 
  read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/web.csv',
    col_types = cols_only(device = col_factor(levels = c("laptop", "tablet", "mobile")),
      referrer = col_factor(levels = c("bing", "direct", "social", "yahoo", "google")),
      purchase = col_logical(), bouncers = col_logical(), duration = col_double(),
      n_visit = col_double(), n_pages = col_double()
    )
  )

ecom
```

### Data Dictionary

- referrer: referrer website/search engine
- device: device used to visit the website
- bouncers: whether a visit bounced (exited from landing page)
- duration: time spent on the website (in seconds)
- purchase: whether visitor purchased
- n_visit: number of visits
- n_pages: number of pages visited/browsed

## Data Sanitization

Let us ensure that the data is sanitized by checking the sources of traffic
and devices used to visit the site. We will use `distinct` to examine the
values in the `referrer` column

<br>

```{r img1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/distinct_1.png")
```

<br>

```{r dplyr2}
distinct(ecom, referrer)
```

and the `device` column as well.

```{r dplyr30}
distinct(ecom, device)
```

## Rename Columns

Columns can be renamed using `rename()`. 

<br>

```{r img2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/rename_1.png")
```

<br>

```{r dplyr3}
rename(ecom, time_on_site = duration)
```

## Data Tabulation

Let us now look at the proportion or share of visits driven by different sources
of traffic. 

<br>

```{r img6, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/tally_count.png")
```

<br>

```{r dplyr14}
ecom %>%
  group_by(referrer) %>%
  tally()
```

We would also like to know the number of bouncers driven by the different 
sources of traffic.

```{r dplyr15}
ecom %>%
  group_by(referrer, bouncers) %>%
  tally()
```

Let us look at how many conversions happen across different devices.

```{r dplyr25}
ecom %>%
  group_by(device, purchase) %>%
  tally() %>%
  filter(purchase)
```

Another way to extract the above information is by using `count`

```{r dplyr17}
ecom %>%
  count(referrer, purchase) %>%
  filter(purchase)
```

## Sampling Data

dplyr offers sampling functions which allow us to specify either the
number or percentage of observations. `sample_n()` allows sampling a specific
number of observations.  

<br>

```{r img3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/sample_frac_n.png")
```

<br>

```{r dplyr4}
sample_n(ecom, 700)
```

We can combine the sampling functions with other dplyr functions as shown below 
where we sample observation after grouping them according to the source of 
traffic.

```{r dplyr5}
ecom %>%
  group_by(referrer) %>%
  sample_n(100)
```

`sample_frac()` allows a specific percentage of observations.

```{r dplyr6}
sample_frac(ecom, size = 0.7)
```

## Data Extraction

In the first [post](https://blog.aravindhebbali.com/2017/12/25/data-wrangling-with-dplyr-part-1/),
we had observed that dplyr verbs always returned a tibble. What if you want to
extract a specific column or a bunch of rows but not as a tibble? 

Use `pull` to extract columns either by name or position. It will return a 
vector. In the below example, we extract the `device` column as a vector. I am 
using `head` in addition to limit the output printed.

### Sample Data

```{r ecom_mini}
ecom_mini <- sample_n(ecom, size = 10)
```

<br>

```{r img4, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/pull_1.png")
```

<br>

```{r dplyr8}
pull(ecom_mini, device)
```

Let us extract the first column from `ecom` using column position instead of 
name.

```{r dplyr9}
pull(ecom_mini, 1) 
```

You can use `-` before the column position to indicate the position in reverse.
The below example extracts data from the last column.

```{r dplyr10}
pull(ecom_mini, -1) 
```

Let us now look at extracting rows using `slice()`. In the below example, we 
extract data starting from the 5th row and upto the 15th row.

<br>

```{r img5, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/slice_1.png")
```

<br>

```{r dplyr11}
slice(ecom, 5:15)
```

Use `n()` inside `slice()` to extract the last row.

```{r dplyr12}
slice(ecom, n())
```

## Between

`between()` allows us to test if the values in a column lie between two specific
values. In the below example, we check how many visits browsed pages between 5 
and 15.

```{r dplyr19}
ecom_sample <- sample_n(ecom, 30)
  
ecom_sample %>%
  pull(n_pages) %>%
  between(5, 15) 
```

## Case When

`case_when()` is an alternative to `if else`. It allows us to lay down the 
conditions clearly and makes the code more readable. In the below example, we
create a new column `repeat_visit` from `n_visit` (the number of previous visits).

```{r dplyr20}
ecom %>%
  mutate(
    repeat_visit = case_when(
      n_visit > 0 ~ TRUE,
      TRUE ~ FALSE
    )
  ) %>%
  select(n_visit, repeat_visit) 
```
