We had published a web scraping <a href="https://blog.rsquaredacademy.com/web-scraping/" target="_blank">tutorial</a> 
a couple of days back and it had received a good response from the #rstats community. While
we thank you for that, we made a mistake in choosing one of the case study as 
pointed out by <a href="https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr" target="_blank">@hrbrmstr</a> in this tweet:

We choose the case study to appeal to a wide audience but in doing so we set 
a bad example. We have removed the case study from our post and apologize
to the #rstats community for our oversight and promise to be more responsible in the
future.

**We reiterate it is very important to read the terms and conditions before scraping data from 
a website and checking the robots.txt file is not sufficient**.
