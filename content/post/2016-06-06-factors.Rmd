## Introduction

This is the eleventh post in the series **Introduction to R**. In the previous [post](), we learnt about dataframes. In this post, we will learn about factors.

- create factors
- order levels
- specify labels
- check levels
- number of levels

Categorical or qualitative data in R is treated as data type `factor`. 

## Create Factors

```{r f1}
args(factor)
```

```{r f2}
devices <- factor(c('Mobile', 'Tablet', 'Desktop'))
devices

# number of levels
nlevels(devices)

# levels
levels(devices)
```

We will learn more about factors in a later post.
