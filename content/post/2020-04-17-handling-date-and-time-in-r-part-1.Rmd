In this new series [Handling Date & Time in R](https://tutorials.rsquaredacademy.com/date-time/index.html), we will learn to handle date & time in R. We will start off by learning how
to **get current date & time** before moving on to understand **how R handles date/time internally**
and the different classes such as `Date` & `POSIXct/lt`. We will spend some time 
exploring **time zones, daylight savings and ISO 8001 standard** for representing date/time.
We will look at all the **weird formats in which date/time come in real world** and learn to
**parse them using conversion specifications**. After this, we will also **learn how to handle date/time
columns while reading external data into R**. We will learn to **extract and update different date/time 
components** such as year, month, day, hour, minute etc., **create sequence of dates** in different ways 
and explore intervals, durations and period. We will end the tutorial by learning how to **round/rollback 
dates**. Throughout the series, we will also **work through a case study** to better understand the 
concepts we learn. Happy learning!

## Introduction {#intro}

```{r cline_youtube_intro, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

```

### Date

Let us begin by looking at the current date and time.  `Sys.Date()` and `today()`  will return the current date.

```{r sys_date}
Sys.Date()
lubridate::today()
```

### Time

`Sys.time()` and `now()` return the date, time and the timezone. In `now()`, we can specify the timezone using the `tzone` argument.

```{r sys_time}
Sys.time()
lubridate::now()
lubridate::now(tzone = "UTC")
```

### AM or PM?

`am()` and `pm()` allow us to check whether date/time occur in the `AM` or `PM`? They return a logical value i.e. `TRUE` or `FALSE`

```{r lub_am}
lubridate::am(now())
lubridate::pm(now())
```

### Leap Year

We can also check if the current year is a leap year using `leap_year()`. 

```{r leap_year}
Sys.Date()
lubridate::leap_year(Sys.Date())
```

### Summary

```{r table_current_date_time, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`Sys.Date()`", "`lubridate::today()`", "`Sys.time()`",
             "`lubridate::now()`", "`lubridate::am()`", "`lubridate::pm()`",
             "`lubridate::leap_year()`")
descrip <- c("Current Date", "Current Date", "Current Time", "Current Time",
             "Whether time occurs in am?", "Whether time occurs in pm?",
             "Check if the year is a leap year?")
data.frame(Function = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

### Your Turn

- get current date
- get current time
- check whether the time occurs in am or pm?
- check whether the following years were leap years
    - 2018
    - 2016

## Case Study {#casestudy}

Throughout the tutorial, we will work on a case study related to transactions of an imaginary trading company. The data set includes information about invoice and payment dates.

### Data

```{r import, eval=FALSE}
transact <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/transact.csv')
```

```{r show, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
transact <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/transact.csv')
transact
```

We will explore more about reading data sets with date/time columns after learning how to 
parse date/time. We have shared the code for reading the data sets used in the practice
questions both in the Learning Management System as well as in our GitHub repo.

### Data Dictionary

The data set has 3 columns. All the dates are in the format (yyyy-mm-dd).

```{r table_data_dict, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("Invoice", "Due", "Payment")
descrip <- c("Invoice Date", "Due Date", "Payment Date")
data.frame(Column = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

In the case study, we will try to answer a few questions we have about the `transact` data.

- extract date, month and year from Due
- compute the number of days to settle invoice
- compute days over due
- check if due year is a leap year
- check when due day in february is 29, whether it is a leap year
- how many invoices were settled within due date
- how many invoices are due in each quarter
